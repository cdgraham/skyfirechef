Day Three for #100DaysOfGatsby.

So far I have create this site using the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) lessons 0-8.

Now you may be wondering what a strange name for a site, Sky Fire Chef. And it is. I don't really remember how I ended up with it. My friend and I were registers some names and registered skyfirewinds.com and skyfirechef.com. I believe it was supposed to be skyfirechief.com but we missed that we spelled it wrong.

Long story short I have just kept the domain for all these years and since I wasn't doing anything with it I figured why not.

Hope you all enjoy it.

Cheers,
Christopher
