Day Two of #100DaysOfGatsby.

On day two I have decided to bring back my personal site [cdgraham.com](https://cdgraham.com) using Gatsby and a starter called gatsby-simplefolio. It is a minimalist one-page design that looks nice.

I had started with the gatsby default starter but as I was looking around for some design ideas I stumbled on to this starter and decided to use it. Basically had what I was looking for and I thought it would be a lot quicker then creating all of that by hand.

It took me longer to write my tagline and about me than to make the changes to the code and get the site online. I think it actually took longer for my dns to update than the changes to the code took.

That's pretty cool, except for the waiting around to check the live site!

Cheers,
Christopher
