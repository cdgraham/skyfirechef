## Day 2

Day 2 of #100DaysOfGatsby has been spent changing the styling for the site. 

I remove the typography from Gatsby and added Tailwind CSS. So far of what I have seen of Tailwind CSS it's pretty amazing and easy to use.

I have learned and lot over the last two days and have a ton of ideas floating aroung my head.

Some things that need to be done or I am thinking about doing:
* Styling the markdown from the .md post pages with Tailwind CSS
* Add a resource page for my development links and online tools.
* More styling changes.
* Mobile responsive, like changing the navigation items to hamburger dropdown menu.
* Moving this site to Netlify.
* Moving my smaller sites to Gatsby with markdown.
* Moving the larger sites to Gatsby as a frontend to a headless Wordpress.

Cheers,
Christopher
