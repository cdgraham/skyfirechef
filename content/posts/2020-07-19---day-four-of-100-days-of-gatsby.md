#Day 4

Day 4 of #100DaysOfGatsby has been spent changing the styling for the site. 

I remove the typography from Gatsby and added Tailwind CSS. So far of what I have seen of Tailwind CSS it's pretty amazing and easy to use.

I have learned and lot over the last two days and have a ton of ideas floating aroung my head.

Some things that need to be done or I am thinking about doing:
+ Styling the markdown from the .md post pages with Tailwind CSS
+ Add a resource page for my development links and online tools.
+ More styling changes.
+ Mobile responsive, like changing the navigation items to hamburger dropdown menu.
+ Moving this site to Netlify.
+ Moving my smaller sites to Gatsby with markdown.
+ Moving the larger sites to Gatsby as a frontend to a headless Wordpress.

Maybe I should create a ToDo list page on this site as well?

Cheers,
Christopher
