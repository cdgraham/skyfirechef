#Day five

Day 5 of #100DaysOfGatsby has been spent changing the styling for the site again.

I enjoyed using Tailwind CSS for the styling of the site. I was easy to change styling for any element I wanted. I haven't spent a lot of time using it yet, but I will definitely be using it in the future. Looks like they are coming out with Tailwind-UI which will have the UI elements done for you, like headers, footers, cards, pricing lists, etc. like Chakra-UI. I have thought about purchasing it but it may be too early for me to know if it's worth it or not. Or if I would even use it.

Which is why today I decide to switch from Tailwind CSS to Chakra-UI. One of the issues I had when I tried Tailwind was the markdown blog post weren't styled. I did the rest of the site and when I got to the blog posts found I couldn't add Tailwind directly. It seems I would have to add some css files for those elements. I figured there is probably a way to add global styling.

So anyways, I decide to try Chakra-UI. First I want to try different things as part of the whole learning process. And second because I thought it would style the blog posts. As I would learn I was wrong about the posts.

Charka-UI is different as it's a framework of components rather than just css. So you use Box instead of a div, Text instead of a paragraph element, etc. You have loads of elements to use, Flex, Sliders, I especially like the Toast one. It is very powerful and easy to use so again I can see myself using this on in the future as well.

Haven't used it very much so can't say too much about it yet. The negative points I would say are the website needs a search function, and if you are trying to move an existing site with a lot of code it may be too much to try and change all the elements to Chakra-UI elements.

Cheers,
Christopher
