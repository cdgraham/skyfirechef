Day one of #100DaysOfGatsby.

I spent most of day one going through the [GatsbyJS.org](https://gatsbyjs.org) website. Reading about it and doing the basic tutorial. I created a couple of the starter sites, the Hello World starter (gatsby-starter-hello-world) and the default starter (gatsby-starter-default). All developers know you have to start with a hello world application/site when you first start learning a new language.

A pretty light day with a lot of reading and researching about Gatsby.

It's amazing how quick you can get a static website setup and running.

Cheers,
Christopher
